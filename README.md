harbour-metaldays
=================

This is an unofficial Sailfish OS app to display the running order of
[MetalDays](http://http://metaldays.net/) festival in slovenia. 

As there is no official API to access the running order, this app
scrapes the website for the necessary information.

This is work in progess and needs activated developer mode and
`devel-su` access on your jolla phone. I will not find the time to wrap
up this app for this year's MetalDays, but I will provide an installable
rpm for next year.
